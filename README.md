Several popular charts in D3 for general purpose

This is a demo about how to create several popular visualizations in D3.js.

I tried my best to create those visualizations for general purpose, which
means you can directly use them in your own project.

Please check "data_source" folder to see what kind of JSON data format is
needed in visualizations.

Please clearly identify "id" of divs where you want to put visualizations
in your html file.

"general.js" contains all configurations needed for visualizations. It's
enough to only figure out how those configurations work for visualizations
if time is short.

Please make sure to include jQuery and D3.js source in your project.

In "js" folder, different js files contain different visualizations, please
include those that you need in your project.
